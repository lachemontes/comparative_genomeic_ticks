# comparative_genomeic_ticks
Pipeline and resources for analyzing the evolution of chemosensory receptor genes across 14 tick species using genomic and transcriptomic data.
This repository contains all scripts, data, and documentation for a comparative genomics project focused on chemosensory receptor gene evolution in ticks. It includes quality assessment of genome assemblies (QUAST, BUSCO), orthology inference, gene annotation, and visualization tools.

The tutorial-style structure is designed to be fully reproducible and beginner-friendly, with step-by-step explanations for each analysis.
Focus species: Ixodes ricinus
Tools: QUAST, BUSCO, OrthoFinder, InterProScan, Conda, Singularity ... <br>
Bonus: Includes custom scripts for high-performance computing (SLURM-compatible)

Whether you’re a student in crisis or not, a tick researcher, or just exploring genome analysis — welcome!
